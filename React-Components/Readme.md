Hello Everyone, 

In this directory i've create a basic react app for understanding the topic **React Components**.
So, here we've a main file index.js which work for rendering the things and contains a **Master Component named as App.jsx**.
App.jsx contains another 3 subcontains which are mainly render on the display like we've Heading.jsx (a component for headings), Paragraph.jsx (a component for paragraphs) and OrderedList.jsx (a componet for Order list with list items)


Here, i've learned about **React Components**
